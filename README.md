Work Plan:
1. Research & Analysis:
     Audience Personas:
       Name: Saad
       Age: 64

     his Background:
      Saad is a retired teacher living in an urban area. He enjoys spending time with his grandchildren and follows several regular medications for his heart and diabetes. He has a basic smartphone and mainly uses it for calls, WhatsApp, and viewing photos sent by his family.
      
      * Skill Level: Low to moderate; Saad can answer calls, read messages, and open basic apps, but gets easily confused with updates, small text, or complex menus
      * Support System: His eldest daughter helps him set up and troubleshoot his phone.
      
      Daily Routine:
      * Saad wakes up early, takes his morning medication with breakfast, enjoys watching TV in the living room, and goes for short walks.
      * Sets alarms on his phone, but often ignores or forgets them if busy.
      * Family often reminds him about medications via phone calls.
      
      Needs & Challenges:
      * Forgets or confuses medication times, especially when his day changes.
      * Slight hearing impairment, so he sometimes misses phone alarms.
      * Finds changing settings or navigating multiple app screens overwhelming.
      * Wants to feel independent but likes knowing family can help if needed.
      
      Goals:
      * Stay healthy and take medication on time without always needing family reminders.
      * Use a very easy app with clear, loud alerts—preferably in his daughter’s voice.
      * Be able to contact his daughter or doctor quickly if needed.
      * Avoid apps that require constant updates, many notifications, or remembering passwords.
      
      Motivation Words:
      * Simplicity
      * Independence
      * Safety
      * Family connection
        
      How “Sandak” solves Saad’s pain points:
      * Single-screen interface with large, readable text and visuals.
      * Personalized voice reminders (“Saad, time for your heart medicine!” in his daughter’s voice).
      * Large, easy-to-press confirmation button.
      * Quick-access emergency button.
      * Daughter can log in remotely to adjust settings or check-in.
      * No hidden menus, minimal steps, and no unnecessary app notifications.
